# Phase 3 — Private MLflow (plan §5/§8). Cloud Run v2 (private) + Cloud SQL
# Postgres + GCS artifacts (proxied) + a dedicated least-privilege SA.
#
# SECURITY (non-negotiable, plan §5):
#   * Private = simply NO allUsers/allAuthenticatedUsers run.invoker binding.
#     The only invoker is the operator (below). sa-tick is deferred to Phase 4.
#   * sa-mlflow gets EXACTLY three grants: cloudsql.client (project),
#     objectAdmin on the ONE artifacts bucket, secretAccessor on the ONE DB
#     secret. Never the default Compute SA.
#   * DB password lives in Secret Manager, injected at deploy — never in the
#     image or git. (It does render into TF state; the private+versioned state
#     bucket is the control — plan §5.)
#   * --artifacts-destination (NOT --default-artifact-root): the server proxies
#     GCS so only sa-mlflow touches the bucket; clients need only run.invoker.
